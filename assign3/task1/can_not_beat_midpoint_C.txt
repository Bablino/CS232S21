MidpointC uses the binary of each number to pull out the necessary power of 2's to comine the numbers to have the proper result. For example -2 and 1. The binary for -2 is 0x1111 1110, 0 is used as the indicator for the necessary power of 2 since this is a negative number, so it would be 1*-2^1=-2. 1 in binary is 0x0000 0001 pulling out only one necessary power of 2 being 1*2^0. However when adding these two, midpointC uses x&y to pull out any power of 2's that both numbers have in common, and x^y to pull out the ones that differ. This results in getting no power of 2's in x&y = 0, and x^y pulling out no power of 2's needed within the negative number1. This results in the returns statement having return 0 + -1 resulting in -1 for the answer since it is using signed numbers.
