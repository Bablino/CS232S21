midpoint_original(2147483647,2147483646)
midpoint_A(-2147483648,2147483647)

I used INT_MAX and INT_MAX-1 to fail midpoint_original test. It failed because INT_MAX is [0x01111111111111111111111111111111] and INT_MAX-1 is [0x01111111111111111111111111111110] so the midpoint of INT_MAX and INT_MAX-1 is expected to be [0x01111111111111111111111111111110]. However, midpoint_A failed when it computes [y-x] because its result is [0x01111111111111111111111111111110 -      0x01111111111111111111111111111111 = 0x111001100110011001100110011001].

I used INT_MIN and INT_MAX to fail midpoint_A test. It failed because INT_MIN is [0x10000000000000000000000000000000] and INT_MAX is [0x01111111111111111111111111111111] so the midpoint of INT_MIN and INT_MAX is expected to be [0x11111111]. However, midpoint_A failed when it computes [y-x] because its result is [0x10000000000000000000000000000000 -      0x01111111111111111111111111111111 = 0x10000000000000000000000000000000].
